<p>1. Where did the lady find the bear cub? How did she bring it up?
<br>
Ans: The lady found the bear cub in the forest near her house. She brought it up by feeding him milk from a bottle. It was a small and helpless baby when she found him.
<br>
<br>
2. The bear grew up but 'he was a most amiable bear'. Give three examples to prove this.
<br>
Ans: The following examples prove that 'he was the most amiable bear' :
<br>
1. He sat outside his kennel and looked with his intelligent eyes amicably at the cattle grazing in the field.
<br>
2. The children rode his back and have been found more than once sleeping harmlessly in his kennel between his two paws.
<br>
3. The three dogs loved to play various games with him. They used to tease him by pulling his ears.
<br>
<br>
3. What did the bear eat? There were two things he was not allowed to do. What were they?
<br>
Ans: The bear ate bread, porridge, potato, cabbage, and turnip. He was disallowed from picking apples from the trees. Later, he discovered that it was unlawful. He was also disallowed from touching the beehives. He was put on the chain as a result of his actions.
<br>
<br>
4. When was the bear tied up with a chain? Why?
<br>
Ans: Generally the bear was tied up with a chain only at night. He was tied up whenever he did any mischievous behavior. But, on Sunday the lady visited her sister who lived on the other side of the mountain lake. It was not safe to let the bear free near the forest. So, on Sundays, the bear was chained up for the whole day.
<br>
<br>
5. What happened one Sunday when the lady was going to her sister's house? What did the lady do? What was the bear's reaction?
<br>
Ans: One Sunday when the lady was going to her sister's house she had chained him up as usual and was about halfway through the forest when she thought she heard the cracking of a tree branch on the winding footpath behind her. When she turned around, she was startled to see the bear approaching at full speed.
<br>
The lady was furious; she was already late for lunch, there was no time to take him home, she didn't want him to accompany her, and besides, he had been extremely naughty in disobeying her. She asked him to go back right away in the most stern voice she could muster, while threatening him with her parasol.
<br>
The bear's reaction was that it stopped a moment and looked at her with his cunning eyes, but did not want to go back and kept on sniffing at her.
<br>
<br>
6. Why was the bear looking sorry for himself in the evening? Why did the cook get angry with her mistress?
<br>
Ans: Yes, the bear was looking sorry for himself because since the evening he was sitting outside his kennel in his regular spot. The cook was enraged with her mistress because she reprimanded the bear, who had been sitting motionless on his haunches, as meek as an angel, looking at the gate for the mistress to return.
<br>
<br>
7. Most people keep dogs and cats as pets. Can you think of some unusual pets that people keep?
<br>
Ans: The unusual pets that people often keep are: horses, monkeys, guinea pigs, parrots, etc.
<br>
<br>
8. The second bear did not attack the lady because he was afraid of her. Do you agree?
<br>
Ans: The second bear did not attack the lady because he too was a friendly bear. He was charging towards her and it seemed as if he wanted to sit near her heels. The lady reprimanded him and even smacked him with her parasol, believing he was her pet bear. The bear did not retaliate furiously, but instead slowly turned around and walked away, possibly upset at being yelled at.</p>
