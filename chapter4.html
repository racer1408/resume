<br>

<br>
<br>
9. Why did the wise old bird say, 'Chandni is the winner'? 
<br>
Ans: The wise old bird said that Chandni was the winner because she chose death in an open field over life in a closed hut. For her, freedom was more important than life. Though Chandni was weak and small as compared to the wolf, still she put up a really brave fight. She did not run away like a coward but stood firmly on her legs like a soldier in front of a treacherous army. She struggled all through the night with the wolf but she was found dead, covered in blood in the morning.
<br>
<br>
10. 'Death in an open field is better than life in a small hut,' Chandni said to herself. Was it the right decision? Give reasons for your answer.
<br>
Ans: Freedom necessitates bravery and the ability to tackle any problem or scenario. Chandni could have returned to Abbu Khan after spotting the wolf. But for her freedom, was more valuable than life. To keep her freedom, she chose to battle the wolf, telling herself that success or failure was a matter of chance and that she had to fight hard. She battled with all her might, and she won.
<br>
<br>
11. Freedom is life. Discuss this with reference to 'Chandni' and 'I Want Something in a Cage'. 
<br>
Ans: Freedom is life. Being enslaved is the same as being dead. Humans, birds, and animals all want their freedom. The stories "I Want Something in a Cage'' and "Chandni" highlights the value and significance of freedom itself. 
<br>
In the first case, a man who had been imprisoned for ten years rescued the doves because he related himself with the caged birds and their longing to fly. Whereas, in the latter case, the goats' desire to roam freely in the hills surpassed their fear of the wolf that resided there, they left Abbu Khan one by one.
<br>
Chandni's decision to confront the wolf rather than return to the safety of Abbu Khan's estate demonstrated that she valued freedom immensely. For her, dying in a wide open field seemed easier than living in a tiny hut. Hence this story shows that one needs to be brave and courageous to live a free life. Even if the life with freedom is transitory and short lived, it is better than a long life in captivity.</p>
