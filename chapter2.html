Ans: Yes, Kari seemed to be enjoying his bath in the river. He lay down on the sandbank while his friend rubbed his back. He stayed in the river for a long time. When the water rubbed down his back, he shrieked with pleasure.
<br>
<br>
3. Finding Good Twigs for Kari Took a Long Time. Why?
<br>
Ans: It took a long time to find good twigs for Kari because his friend tried to get the most delicate and tender twigs, for which he had to climb all kinds of trees. The elephant would not touch a twig if it was even a little distorted, so it was not an easy job to cut the twigs sharply and thus it took a long time for his friend to sharpen his hatchet and cut the twigs neatly.
<br>

4. Why Did Kari Push His Friend Into the Stream?

5. Kari Was Like a Baby. What are the Main Points of Comparison?
<br>
Ans: There are many factors that show that Kari was a baby. These factors are that Kari needed to be trained to be good, just like we do with a baby. He needed to be told when to sit or stand or walk at what pace at what time. Kari also needed to be scolded in order to not be naughty otherwise he would not stop and be more mischievous.

<br>
6. Kari Helped Himself to All the Bananas in the House Without Anyone Noticing It. How Did He Do It?
<br>
Ans: Kari steals all the bananas from the table by putting his trunk in a snake-like movement through the dining room window. He takes all the bananas and disappears with all the bananas before anyone notices him.
<br>
<br>
7. Kari Learns the Commands To Sit and To Walk. What Were the Instructions for Each Command?
<br>
Ans: Kari's friend instructed him by pulling his ear and saying the word 'Dhat' to make him sit. To make him walk, he used to pull his trunk forward and say 'Mali'.
<br>
<br>
8. What is 'The Master Call'? Why Is It the Most Important Signal for an Elephant To Learn?
<br>
Ans: The 'master call' refers to a strange hissing and howling sound which seems as if a snake and a tiger are fighting. It is considered as the most important signal for an elephant to learn because if the elephant's master was in any trouble, he would give a master call and the elephant would come to his master to help him out of the trouble.</p>
