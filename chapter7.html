1. How does Tilloo manage to find his way to the ‘forbidden passage’? 
<br>
Ans: While his father was enjoying a short rest at home, Tilloo managed to get hold of his security card. Then, evading his watchful mother’s eye, he made his way to the forbidden passage. A metal door barred his entry. However, he had watched his father slip the magic card into a slot. He did the same and the door opened noiselessly. He saw a well-lit passage. Snatching the card which had come out of another slot in the wall, Tilloo started his march along a gentle upward slope.
<br>
2. What did Tilloo hope to see once he emerged from his underground home?
<br>
Ans: Once he emerged from his underground home, Tilloo hoped to see the sun if it was day time or the stars, if it was night.
<br>
3. Why did Tilloo’s father advise him not to try to reach the surface of the planet?
<br>
Ans: Tilloo’s father advised him not to reach the surface of the planet as an ordinary person could not survive there. The reason for this was that the air at the surface was too thin to breathe and the temperature was so low that one could freeze to death.
<br>
4. What changes had occurred, which forced people to live in underground homes? 
<br>
Ans: People were forced to live in underground homes because the sun, which had provided them with sustenance, had turned hostile. It changed only slightly, but the change was sufficient to upset the balance of nature on the planet. First the birds became extinct, then the animals and finally the fishes. The superior technology of human beings enabled them to survive underground.

<b>EXERCISES</b>
<br>
Discuss the following topics in groups.
<br>
1. If you had to live in a home like Tilloo’s, what parts of life would you find most difficult? What compensations might there be?
<br>
Ans: Living underground in artificial conditions without the light/warmth of the stars and the sun, must be very troublesome and dull. The only compensation for such a home is safety and security, controlled light, and heat.
<br>
2. What, if anything, might drive mankind to make their homes 
<br>
underground?
<br>
Ans: Mankind might be forced to live underground if the living conditions on the surface of the planet become insupportable for life. Excessive heat or cold might be one such reason. Pollution of air, destruction of all plants and trees might lead to mankind living underground.
<br>
3. Do you think there is life on other planets? Can you guess what kind of people there may be on them? In what ways are they likely to be different from us?
<br>
Ans: Scientists are trying hard to find out if there is any form of life on planets around the sun. So far they have sent spacecraft to the moon and Mars, collected samples of soil, and taken snapshots. But they have not found definite proof of life on them. The kind of people, if they exist at all on any other planet, would be quite different from us. They must have adjusted themselves to a strange and unfriendly environment there.</p>
