16. Shoot animals with a camera, not with a gun.
<br>
Ans:  Birds and animals form a part of all the gorgeous elements that nature provides us. Shooting animals with a gun will only result in the extinction of their species over time.
<br>
Filming or shooting them using a camera, or taking images of them, makes it possible for their beauty to be shared with a larger audience and hence this is how their beauty could be heightened. Animals, like humans, are living beings with the right to live a free life. Man's perverseness can be seen in the way he kills them for joy and entertainment.
<br>
<br>
17. Keeping pets helps us become more loving and tolerant. It also helps us respect life in any form. Do you agree?
<br>
Ans: Keeping pets indeed makes one more loving and tolerant. Pets, like children, demand a lot of care and attention.
<br>
In return, they too bestow their love and affection and always stay loyal. If we learn to love and respect animal life, we would also be able to harbour genuine love and care for other fellow human beings and other forms of life.
<br>
<br>
18. Have you heard of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)? What do they do?
<br>
